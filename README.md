# Interactive Navigation Menu

## Project Overview
This project implements an interactive navigation menu using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the page and remains visible while scrolling.  
It dynamically changes its **style on scroll** and provides **hover effects** on menu items for better user interaction.

## Objective
- Create a fixed navigation menu visible on all pages
- Add hover effects to menu items
- Change navigation menu style when the page is scrolled
- Improve user experience with smooth transitions

---

## Features
- Fixed-position navigation bar
- Color/style change on scroll
- Hover effects on menu items
- Smooth CSS transitions
- Simple and responsive layout

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure of the navigation menu  
- **CSS** – Styling, hover effects, fixed positioning  
- **JavaScript** – Detecting scroll and applying dynamic styles  

---

## How It Works
- The navigation bar uses `position: fixed` to stay at the top of the page.
- CSS `:hover` pseudo-class is used to change menu item styles on hover.
- JavaScript listens to the window scroll event and updates the navigation bar style when the user scrolls down.
